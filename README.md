The project involves the analysis of a dataset comprising 7,304 records of average daily electricity consumption by businesses and residents, covering the period from 2013 to 2018. The aim of this analysis is to identify trends in energy consumption over the years.

In this project on the average daily electricity consumption of businesses and residents from 2013 to 2018, I used various Python technologies for data analysis and visualization. First, I used libraries like Pandas to clean and prepare the 7,304 records, handling missing values and formalizing the data for analysis. 

Next, I analyzed trends and patterns in electricity consumption, segmenting the data by user type (businesses and residents). For visualization, I used Seaborn, a library dedicated to statistical graphics, to visually represent the variations and correlations observed. The resulting graphs made it easier to understand the differences in consumption between residents and businesses over the period analyzed.
